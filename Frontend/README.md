## Project Overview
In the current healthcare landscape, patients face challenges when transitioning between hospitals or healthcare providers, resulting in fragmented medical records and delays in treatment. To address these issues, an integrated healthcare application is needed. This application would connect multiple hospitals under a unified platform, allowing for seamless continuity of patient care and access to medical records. By enhancing healthcare accessibility, promoting efficient information exchange, and empowering patients in managing their healthcare decisions effectively, the application aims to revolutionize the delivery of healthcare.
